# Additional concepts

## Interoperability

### Standardising terms

It's certainly nice to know that we accurately entered the prey species names, in the sense that they match the names of known prey species. Doing so will also ensure that our results could be compared with and combined with other studies of moth species (put another way, we would have assured our data are *interoperable* with other studies involving these moth species). To do this, we can use a very nice set of packages that make the whole process a total breeze. Let's try this for the first ten species in the dataset. Note that the first line below installs the __taxize__ add-on package, and is commented out as we only need to run it once).

```{r}
## install.packages("taxize")
## the previous line was commented out. Uncomment it by removing
## the two pounds (##) if you want to run it.
library(taxize) ## load the package
some_species_names <- slice(dd, 1:10) %>%
  pull(Species) ## get first ten species
## query the online database of species names
species_names_reports <- gnr_resolve(some_species_names,
                                     best_match_only = TRUE)
species_names_reports
```

In this report, the final column gives a quick indication of how well the moth species name in the dataset matched a known species name. A score of 1 is the highest match, 0 is the lowest. This tells us that *Ethmia bipunctella* and *Bradycellus verbasci* in the dataset correspond to known species---their matching score in the final column is 0.988. The third species in the dataset, however is *Hoplodrina ambigua/ superstes* and cannot be well matched to an individual known species---it has a score of 0.75. Likely this entry in the dataset corresponds with the text in the paper "When the same haplotype matched more than one species, we ... classified them into a species group". I.e. *H. ambigua* and *H. superstes* could not be distinguished and so were treated as a species group. (It takes a while to make these queries, so we don't run one for every moth species name in the dataset.) There is lots more one can do with species names, but it's a bit beyond the scope of this book, so we now move on.
