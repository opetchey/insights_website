# Insights Workflow {#insights-workflow}

Here are the steps of our general workflow. It is quite common and uncontroversial.

**Planning and preparation steps:**

* Decide upon a question.
* Sketch an answer.
* Research expectations.
* Get feedback and revise.
* Specify hypotheses.
* Get feedback and revise.
* Specify response variables.
* Make predictions.
* Design study.
* Get feedback and revise.
* Write formal proposal.

**Performing the study and getting insights steps:**
* Perform study, including data collection.
* Backup raw data.
* Prepare the data (make it "research and resuse ready").
* Prepare computer, R, and RStudio.
* Read the data into R, and refine the import.
* Tidy the data.
* Clean the data.
* Initial insights.
* Insights about question.

Below we go into a little more detail about the second set of steps, which concern getting insights. These are covered in even more detail the book.

## Preparing the data

If you don't know, e.g. because you did not conduct the study, *before* import into R inspect the datafiles in a spreadsheet program (so long as they're not too big) and note the following:

* if multiple datafiles are used, which contains what
* what variable names are used in the datafiles, and what these mean (i.e. which are response variables, which are explanatory, and what are others)
* number of rows and columns in the datafiles
* arrangement of the data in the datafile, e.g. tidy or not tidy
* any obvious things to deal with (e.g. how missing values are coded, date/time information, codes that need expanding, variable/column names that will need changing)

## Prepare computer, R, and RStudio

* Make a project folder, and data subfolder.
* Make other subfolders, as you like.
* Set up and RProject.
* Create a new script file.
* Describe project in the new script.
* Load any required add-on libraries.

## Read the data into R

* Check number of variables/columns.
* Check number of rows.
* Check variable types.
* Check appropriate reprentation of missing values.

## Tidy the data 

* Ensure there is one observation per row.
* Ensure one type of information is not spread across multiple columns.
* Gather observations into a single column (i.e. tidy the data).

## Clean the data.

* Check for innapropriate duplicates.
* Fix date formatting.
* Replace any codes with informative words.
* Check for appropriate/plausible variable entries, e.g. levels of characters, ranges of numerics.

## Initial insights

* Check numbers of "things", number of experimental units, treatments, treatment combinations, temporal samples
* Calculate response and/or explanatory variable(s) (if required)
* Examine shapes of variables (i.e. inspect the histograms of explanatory and response variables).

## Insights about question posed

* Examine relationships among explanatory variables.
* Reveal and examine relationships relevant to hypotheses/predictions.
* Assess confidence in revealed patterns.
