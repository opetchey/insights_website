*Welcome!* to the Companion Website for the book *Insights from Data with R -- An Introduction for the Life and Environmental Sciences*

*Insights* was authored by the members of [R4ALL](http://r4all.org/), an organisation specialising in teaching R to those who've never used it. And to folk using R already but want to improve their foundation and workflow.

The Preface Chapter of *Insights,* [here is a PDF of the Preface Chapter](assets/Insights_Preface.pdf), describes features of the book, such as its aims, content, structure, intended readership, and relationship to our other book *Getting Started with R*. Some of the text in the Preface may come across as a sales pitch (it probably is), but it also aims to make prospective readers clear about what they will find in *Insights* and why.

[The table of contents of *Insights* as a pdf.](assets/Insights_ToC.pdf).

On this Companion Website you will find information additional to that in the book:

(1) An overview of the [Insights Workflow](#insights-workflow).
(2) [Questions and exercises](#questions-exercises) to work through with each chapter of the book.
(3) [More topics in R](#more-r).
(4) [Additional data analysis concepts](#more-concepts).
(5) An additional Workflow Demonstration: [polity and food diversity](#WFD-food-pol)
(6) An additional Workflow Demonstration: [effects of dietary diversity on populations](#WFD-dietdiv-effect)
(7) A relatively unguided workflow demonstration [effects of dietary restriction on individuals](#WFD-diet-restrict).
(8) An example of how one might complete the previous Workflow Demonstration.
(9) [Model scripts](#modelwf-scripts) for each Workflow Demonstration.
(10) Details of a [live data analysis demonstration](#live-data-demo) that can be used in the very first class of an Introduction to Data Analysis undergraduate classes. It is designed to capture the students' interest.
(11) [More datasets](#more-datasets) that could be developed into new Workflow Demonstrations (perhaps for students to practice with and/or instructors to use).
(12) Some [Related reading](#related-reading).
(13) Answers to the questions that accompany each Chapter.
(14) Any corrections to the published edition of the book.
